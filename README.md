# Workshop on Terrestrial Analogs for Planetary Exploration, Smolka 2021

## Abstract
Utilizing lunar resources is considered the key for future, long-duration explorations of the Moon and once data suggested that water exists in cold traps at the lunar poles, it has become the focus of the scientific interest. Since extraction methods are governed by complex heat and mass transport mechanisms, numerical simulations are used to analyze the transient behavior of the procedure. This research, based on Reissâ€™ study in 2018, extends an existing model of the Lunar Volatile Scout (LVS) by incorporating a revised version of the governing transport equations. Above all, a parametrized description of the resorption process is included. The entire implementation as well as the subsequent studies were done in COMSOL Multiphysics. The results show that the resorption plays a significant role in describing the heat and mass transport inside of the lunar regolith. By varying the expected resorption strength as well as the energy of the bond between the volatile water and its host particle, the simulation could be correlated to a prior experimental setup. Further results include parameter studies for the expected water ratio inside of the sample.
